# Lab Report 4, Speeding from step 4 to 9
Okay, it's back to being not bad.

This entry deals with the steps of doing the tasks on Week 7's page after the timer started.

## Step 4 - Log into ieng6

<up><enter> 
  
 Using the history of the terminal, you can easily access your previous ssh command into the ieng6 server. ssh cs15lwi23atx@ieng.ucsd.edu is the command to login with the ieng6 part to specify the server.

For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

## Step 5 - Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
