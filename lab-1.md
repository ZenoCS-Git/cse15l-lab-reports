# Instructions for CSE 15L Remote Access 
It isn't that bad. Sorta. 

This blog describes instruction for remote access for ieng6.
## Step 1 - Visual Code Studio <3
With our favorite IDE, we can do the remote access stuff. First you need to download this lovely, 
totally not a fake program to phish your information, program [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Make sure to download the version that works with your OS, or if you are doing some wacky virtual 
machine stuff like running windows on a mac, I get a feeling you already know what you are doing. 

If you already have it, you can still re-download for whatever reason or just chill. 

If you are unsure, this be what the install button look like

## Step 2 - Remotely Connecting (You'll hate this or not)

Look. You know that thing that professor said to find your course-specific account and stuff?

You ***have*** to reset your password for this part to work. I know, it's wack, but do it. Also 
write down the password or something since your password manager probably doesn't work with V-Studio. 

Anyways, the lab report instructions didn't say to explain Git so I'm assuming you got downloaded. 
If not, Git is some sort of program that adds a git bash terminal to V-Studio. Good luck googling 
or asking your professor, but moving on.
